This folder contain visulaization table for JhotDraw and Apache-Ant. 
Each image shows overall correlation among the modularity metrics through visualization table representation 
for JhotDraw and Ant data-sets respectively. Values inside the visualization table show the magnitude of association in corresponding cell of metric at the significant level denoted as:
 $p-values( 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1)$ $\Leftrightarrow$ symbols(“***”, “**”, “*”, “.”).
